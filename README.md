## 📖 Detailed Module Documentation

### 1. Access Control Lists (ACL)
Located in: `ACL/`

*   **`ACL_Exercise.sh`**: A comprehensive script that:
    *   Checks for existing Network ACLs.
    *   Creates a new Custom ACL if one doesn't exist.
    *   Adds **Inbound Rules** to allow traffic from a specific IP.
    *   Adds **Outbound Rules** to allow traffic to a specific IP.
    *   Associates the ACL with a specific Subnet.

### 2. Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Located in: `EBS/`

*   **`EBS.sh`**: Automates the lifecycle of an EBS volume:
    *   Creates a high-performance `io2` volume.
    *   Waits for the volume to become available.
    *   Attaches the volume to a specific EC2 instance.
    *   Detaches and deletes the volume (cleanup).
*   **`EBS_Load_Test.sh`**: (If applicable) Script designed to perform load testing or I/O operations on attached volumes.

### 3. Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
Located in: `EC2/`

*   **`EC2.sh`**: The core provisioning script.
    *   **Key Pair**: Creates a secure `.ppk` key pair for SSH access.
    *   **Security Group**: Creates a firewall allowing SSH (22) and HTTP (80) access.
    *   **Launch**: Deploys an Ubuntu `t3.micro` instance with tags.
    *   **Cleanup**: Includes commands to terminate instances and delete security groups.
*   **`EC2_Run_New_Insatance.sh`**: Simplified script for launching new instances quickly.
*   **`Instance_From_LaunchTemplate.sh`**: Launches instances based on pre-defined Launch Templates for consistency.
*   **`User_Data_Script_HTTP_Service.sh`**: A startup script (User Data) that installs the **.NET 8.0 SDK**, clones a custom repository, and sets up a systemd service to run a .NET HTTP server on **port 8002**.
*   **`ApacheServer_UserData_Script.sh`**: Similar to the above, but specifically tailored for Amazon Linux (uses `dnf`), installing Apache and creating a styled HTML page with server info.

### 4. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
Located in: `ELB/`

*   **`ELB.sh`**: Sets up a scalable load balancing architecture.
    *   Creates an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
    *   Creates a **Target Group** and registers EC2 instances.
    *   Creates a **Listener** to forward HTTP traffic from the ALB to the Target Group.

### 5. Route 53
Located in: `Route53/`

*   **`Route53.sh`**: Manages Domain Name System (DNS) configurations.
    *   **Hosted Zones**: Creates Public or Private Hosted Zones based on input.
    *   **Record Sets**: Automates the creation of `A` records to point subdomains to instance IPs.
    *   **Dynamic Updates**: Fetches instance IPs dynamically to update DNS records.

### 6. Simple Storage Service (S3)
Located in: `S3/`

*   **`S3.sh`**: A master script for S3 operations.
    *   **Bucket Management**: Creates and lists buckets.
    *   **Object Operations**: Uploads and deletes files.
    *   **Security**: Manages Public Access Blocks and Object Ownership (ACLs vs. Policies).
    *   **Policies**: Applies custom JSON policies for IP-based or Domain-based restrictions.
*   **Policy Files**:
    *   `Allow_Specific_Domain_policy.json`: Restricts access to a specific referrer domain.
    *   `Allow_Specific_ip_policy.json`: Restricts access to a specific source IP.

### 7. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Located in: `VPC/`

*   **`Design_Network.sh`**: Builds a complete network topology from scratch.
    *   **VPC**: Creates a VPC with a custom CIDR block.
    *   **Subnets**: Provisions Public and Private subnets across multiple Availability Zones.
    *   **Gateways**: Sets up an Internet Gateway (IGW) for public access and a NAT Gateway for private outbound access.
    *   **Route Tables**: Creates Public and Private Route Tables, adds routes, and associates them with the respective subnets.
*   **Diagrams**: Includes `AWS_Netwok_Design.drawio` and images visualizing the network architecture.
